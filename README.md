# Simple IRC Client for ZX Spectrum Next

This is client works only on ZX Spectrum Next.

There some shortcuts:

 * `!j #channel` - will joins specified channel
 * `!l` - will leave current channel(you must switch on channel what you want leave)
 * `!s #channel` or `!s user` - will sets current talk stream to channel or user.
 * `!m user and there goes your message` sends to `user` private message

 If you need send some other command just write it after bang, example: 
 
 ```
 !KICK user
 ```
